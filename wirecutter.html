        <dd>
          The client presented these problems: the site wasn’t mobile-optimized, the quoting process 
          was challenging and inflexible for users and annoying for staff. During discovery and user 
          interviews, we uncovered another significant problem: new users felt confused and unsupported 
          during the configuration process.

        <dd>
          This was an example of a project that required strong advocacy for the new user 
          without sacrificing the return user's experience. This resulted in the design of a 
          unified Resource Center, a single-page Ember app that auto-updates price depending on 
          configurations, and a contextual list of support documents and tutorials that are given 
          depending on where the user is within the quoting process.

        <dd>
          The first iteration of this project was simply a spreadsheet. It wasn’t customizable, it didn’t 
          feel personalized, there was no way to prioritize or order the list. The large team, which involved 
          a number of different departments within the university, wasn’t sure exactly how to move forward.

          I led a Design Sprint – Understand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype, Test. This process solidified 
          our understanding of the problem and helped us progress quickly. After determining which paradigm 
          option made the most sense, we were able to design and implement a solution within a couple months.

        <dd>
          Thousands of recipes, no homepage, minimal tooling to gather analytics, tiny budget. The recipes 
          existed as articles within the Oregonian’s CMS, which added complexity and reduced flexibility.

          I focused on simplicity, readable typography, responsiveness, and leveraging their incredible 
          collection of food photography to add visual interest to the pages. I created a style guide that 
          contains common patterns as well as elements that they’re not currently using, like author profiles 
          and sponsored recipes, but that will help them scale.
