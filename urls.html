        I have been buying ridiculous URLs for a long time. It pains me to think how much 
        I spend each year for these stupid things. Oh geez, I just did the math. Although 
        I don’t yet know what I’ll do with most of these domains, I’m fairly confident 
        that I’ll do <em>something</em> with them. Or I’ll sell them. Speaking of which, why hasn’t 
        someone offered me some serious money for <a href="http://www.crapfood.com" target="_blank">crapfood.com</a> yet? Anyway, here is my 
        site dedicated to:

      <h2 class="url-address">crapfood.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        Obviously, this one will be about shitty food. Bad-tasting food or unhealthy food? 
        I’m not sure. I have no memory of buying this one.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/cuckoo.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">haikucuckoo.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        I love writing haikus. This site is going to be extremely simple – it’ll 
        consist of  just one page displaying a single haiku. If you refresh the page, it 
        shows a new haiku. Perhaps there will be the ability to ‘share’ the poem.

      <img src="/images/urls/chicken.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">chickencandyandtofu.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        A disgusting combo, right? This is another one that I have almost no recollection of 
        purchasing. Was I sleepwalking?

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/wack.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">wearewack.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        One of the many business names I’ve thought of. The ‘wack’ is actually ‘W.A.C.K’, 
        which stands for We Are Cool Kids. So the URL basically translates to We Are We 
        Are Cool Kids.

    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/eggburps.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">eggburps.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        We’re all familiar with the unfortunate reality of egg burps. You eat an egg, especially a 
        hard-boiled one, and you’re bound to get some stinky egg burps. This site is about that.
      </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/eyes.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">whyareyoureyesweird.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        This one’s a mystery to me. I’m pretty sure this was a <a href="http://www.veronicapisano.com" target="_blank">Veronica</a> idea.

      <img src="/images/urls/music.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">mildduds.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        One of my many musical pseudonyms. I’ve also gone by Mr Belvedere’s Stereo 
        and Strengthling. Which reminds me – I should really buy strengthling.com.

    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/gerbil.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">americangerbil.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        I think this’ll be a site that sells fancy dolls, like American Girl Dolls. 
        But they’re gerbils. Amercan Gerbils.

      <img src="/images/urls/toilet.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">toilettegazette.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        This is one of my better ideas. It’ll be a newspaper that you read while 
        on the toilet. Perhaps the stories will be made up, or simply insignificant. 
        I’m not sure yet.
      </p>

    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/thirdwheel.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">thirdwheel.fun</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        This is going to be the name of the design studio I eventually start with husband 
        and wife duo <a href="http://www.veronicapisano.com" target="_blank">Veronica</a> & <a href="https://www.michaeljamespisano.com/" target="_blank">Michael</a>. A great name for a 3-person studio, right?

    <div class="col-sm-4 mbl">
      <img src="/images/urls/toiletnap.gif" />
      <h2 class="url-address">toiletnap.com</h2>
      <p class="url-description">
        Self-explanatory. Or just check out <a href="http://www.toiletnap.com" target="_blank">toiletnap.com</a>.
        Also, I just realized I own 2 URLs that contain the word ‘toilet.’
